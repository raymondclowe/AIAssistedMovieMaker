This app is to assist in a workflow that can be done by hand, I've done a small amount and I'm going to show you how it went.

First, I approach an AI with the basic idea:

------------- here I'm using just one chapter, but you can see I could do the whole book, either in one go or chapter by chapter.

### USER
Think about a synopsis of chapter 1 of the book “High Crusade” in bullet points, then create a screen play for chapter one; include all details needed to pitch this screenplay for a TV movie.

### ASSISTANT

<summary>Thought for 14 seconds</summary>
&gt; **Defining the Core Elements**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m currently focused on the fundamental elements. Specifically, I&#x27;m parsing the request and identifying the source material, which is Chapter 1 of Poul Anderson&#x27;s *The High Crusade*. My primary objective is to create a bullet-point synopsis.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Refining the Synopsis Points**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m now refining the bullet points for the synopsis, ensuring they accurately capture the key plot events. I&#x27;m prioritizing the order and clarity to ensure logical flow. The alien&#x27;s perspective, juxtaposed with the reactions of the humans, is of particular interest as it shows a core theme.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Formulating a Plan of Action**
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, so I&#x27;ve finalized my plan. First up, I need to deconstruct Chapter 1 of *The High Crusade*. Then, I&#x27;ll draft those essential bullet points for the synopsis. Next, I&#x27;ll develop the pitch package, focusing on a killer logline, genre definition, and character bios. Only then will I start formatting the screenplay for Chapter 1. The key is to convey that satirical blend.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Evaluating the Scene Structure**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m now carefully examining the proposed screenplay structure. I&#x27;m focusing on the contrast between the medieval setting and the arrival of the alien ship. My goal is to maximize the impact of the aliens&#x27; appearance and the ensuing clash. I&#x27;ll need to carefully craft the dialogue to reveal character and advance the plot efficiently.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Structuring the Scene&#x27;s Narrative**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m presently focused on the pacing. I&#x27;m ensuring a smooth transition from the medieval setting to the arrival of the alien ship. I&#x27;m particularly concentrating on Roger&#x27;s reaction to the alien threat, wanting to highlight his pragmatism and strategic mind, rather than fear. Brother Parvus&#x27; narration, the humor and the chaos of the encounter must shine through, so the contrast is clear.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Revising Story Elements**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m now revising my notes. I&#x27;m taking the previous ideas and developing those key character roles. The core of my plan remains the same. I&#x27;m still focused on ensuring the synopsis aligns with the screenplay&#x27;s structure. I&#x27;m making sure everything moves towards the pitch materials, with its logline, character breakdowns, and tone, all of which must have synergy.
&gt; 
&gt; 
</details>
Here is a breakdown of Chapter 1 of Poul Anderson’s *The High Crusade*, adapted into a pitch package and a screenplay.

### Part 1: Synopsis of Chapter 1 (Bullet Points)

*   **The Setting:** The year is 1345. The location is the English town of Ansby in Lincolnshire.
*   **The Status Quo:** Sir Roger de Tourneville is drilling his troops (knights, archers, and yeomen). They are preparing to depart to fight in the Hundred Years' War alongside King Edward III in France.
*   **The Inciting Incident:** A massive, cylindrical silver craft descends from the sky, landing in the common pasture. It is enormous—over a mile long.
*   **The Misinterpretation:** The medieval English do not understand "spaceships." They assume it is either a French trick, a miracle, or a demon.
*   **The Alien Contact:** A Wersgorix scout (blue-skinned, tailed alien) emerges. He views the humans as primitive savages. He uses a handheld weapon to incinerate a soldier to demand submission (Shock and Awe).
*   **The Reaction:** Instead of fleeing in superstitious terror (as the aliens expect of primitives), Sir Roger acts on military instinct. He views the "demon" as a tactical threat.
*   **The Battle:** Sir Roger orders a charge. The longbowmen unleash a storm of arrows (which the alien energy shields were not calibrated for, as they expect high-velocity energy weapons, not low-velocity wood). The knights close the distance and engage in brutal hand-to-hand melee combat.
*   **The Outcome:** The English slaughter the alien crew, who are unused to physical ferocity. They capture the ship.
*   **The Cliffhanger:** Sir Roger stands amidst the dead aliens and the high-tech ship. He decides that instead of sailing to France, they will use this captured "flying tower" to win the war for England and perhaps liberate the Holy Land.

***

### Part 2: TV Movie Pitch Package

**Title:** The High Crusade
**Format:** 90-Minute TV Movie / Pilot
**Genre:** Sci-Fi / Historical Action / Satire
**Logline:** In 1345, an alien scout ship lands in England expecting to conquer primitive savages, but they execute the invasion so poorly that a regiment of medieval knights captures their starship and takes the crusade to the stars.

**Character Breakdowns:**

*   **SIR ROGER DE TOURNEVILLE (30s):** A pragmatic, fearless, and slightly arrogant English Baron. He is not a scientist; he is a soldier. He treats alien technology with the same casual tactical utility as a trebuchet.
*   **BROTHER PARVUS (50s):** A Franciscan friar and the story’s narrator. He is intelligent and observant, trying to reconcile theology with the existence of blue aliens.
*   **CATHERINE (20s):** Roger’s wife. Fierce, intelligent, and more diplomatically savvy than her husband.
*   **THE WERSGORIX:** A race of galactic conquerors who have become soft, relying entirely on push-button technology and having forgotten the grit of hand-to-hand combat.

### Part 3: Screenplay - Chapter One

**SCENE 1**

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. LINCOLNSHIRE FIELDS - DAY (1345 A.D.)**

Mud. Thick, cloying English mud.

Boots stomp through it.

BROTHER PARVUS (V.O.)
I have been asked to write the history of these strange times. My name is Brother Parvus. And I swear by the saints that every word is true.

We pan up to reveal SIR ROGER DE TOURNEVILLE (30s), armored in chainmail and surcoat. He looks bored.

AROUND HIM: The hustle of a war camp. Archers fletching arrows. Blacksmiths hammering iron.

PARVUS (V.O.)
It was the year of our Lord 1345. We were in the town of Ansby. Sir Roger was gathering men to fight for King Edward against the French. We expected Frenchmen.

Sir Roger turns to his captain, SIR OWAIN.

SIR ROGER
The archers are sluggish, Owain. If they loose that slowly in France, they’ll serve as pincushions for the Genoese crossbowmen.

SIR OWAIN
They are tired, my lord. And fearful of the omens.

SIR ROGER
Omens do not win wars. Steel wins wars. Drill them again.

**EXT. PASTURE - CONTINUOUS**

Suddenly, the sky DARKENs. Not clouds. Something solid blocks the sun.

The casual noise of the camp dies instantly. Horses rear. Men look up, mouths agape.

A SOUND tears the air—a high-pitched whine, like a thousand dentist drills, escalating into a THUNDEROUS BOOM.

**EXT. PASTURE - CONTINUOUS**

A SHIP lands.

It is not aerodynamic. It is a massive cylinder of gleaming silver, easily a mile long. It crushes the pasture, flattening an old stone wall and a few unfortunate sheep.

Steam hisses from the base of the craft. The heat ripples the air.

The English troops are frozen. Some cross themselves. Some drop their weapons.

SIR ROGER
(Squinting)
Is that... French?

BROTHER PARVUS steps up beside him, trembling.

BROTHER PARVUS
It is a tower of Babel, my lord. Or a demon’s chariot.

SIR ROGER
(Hand on hilt)
Demon or Frenchman, it’s ruining my pasture.

**EXT. ALIEN SHIP - AIRLOCK - CONTINUOUS**

A hiss of hydraulics. A ramp descends.

Standing at the top is a WERSGOR SCOUT. He is blue-skinned, snout-faced, wearing a metallic tunic. He holds a sleek, silver tube (a blast-rifle).

The Wersgor looks down at the medieval army with utter contempt.

**EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS**

The soldiers begin to back away in terror.

SOLDIER #1
St. George protect us!

The Wersgor Scout raises the silver tube. He points it at a cow grazing nearby.

*ZAP.*

A beam of blue fire disintegrates the cow. Nothing but ash remains.

The Wersgor points the weapon at a sturdy YEOMAN standing near the front.

*ZAP.*

The Yeoman vanishes in a flash of light.

The Wersgor barks a command in a guttural, alien language. He gestures for the humans to kneel.

PARVUS (V.O.)
The creature expected panic. It expected us to grovel before its lightning.

**CLOSE ON SIR ROGER:**

His eyes aren't filled with fear. They are filled with **rage**.

SIR ROGER
(To himself)
He killed Red Dick. That was my best fletcher.

Roger draws his broadsword. The steel scrapes loudly against the scabbard.

SIR ROGER
(Bellowing)
MONTJOIE! SAINT DENIS!

The sheer audacity of the shout freezes everyone.

SIR ROGER
Have at them! For England!

**EXT. FIELD - BATTLE**

The Wersgor Scout pauses. This is not in the simulation. Primitives are supposed to run.

Instead, SIR ROGER is charging up the ramp, screaming a war cry.

Behind him, the trance breaks. A thousand men realize that if the Baron is charging, they better charge too.

SIR ROGER
ARCHERS! LOOSE!

**EXT. ARCHER LINES**

The Archer Captain screams.

ARCHER CAPTAIN
DRAW! LOOSE!

Two hundred longbows snap.

**EXT. AIRLOCK RAMP**

A black cloud of arrows whistles through the air.

The Wersgor taps a button on his belt. A shimmering FORCE FIELD flares up around him.

*Ping. Ping. Ping.*

The arrows bounce off harmlessly? **NO.**

The field flickers. It was designed to stop high-velocity energy bolts, not heavy, slow-moving wood and iron. An arrow slips through the frequency gap.

*THWANCK.*

It takes the Wersgor in the throat.

The alien gurgles, blue blood spraying, and tumbles down the ramp.

**EXT. RAMP - CONTINUOUS**

Sir Roger reaches the body. He doesn't stop. He leaps over it and runs *into* the spaceship.

SIR ROGER
UP THE RAMP! BEFORE THEY SEAL THE GATES!

**INT. SPACESHIP - CORRIDOR**

Sterile. White lights. Metals that don't exist on Earth.

Roger and his knights storm in, muddy boots clanging on the pristine floor.

Two more ALIENS appear in the hallway, fumble-fingered, trying to unholster sidearms. They look panicked. They’ve never seen a human in a rage.

SIR OWAIN swings a mace.
*CRUNCH.*
An alien skull caves in.

A KNIGHT thrusts a sword.
*SCHLICK.*
Through an alien chest.

It is a massacre. The aliens are soft, weak, relying on tech. The humans are veterans of hand-to-hand slaughter.

**INT. SHIP BRIDGE**

A massive room of screens and flashing lights.

The ALIEN COMMANDER is trying to lift off.

The door BURSTS OPEN.

Sir Roger strides in, blood (red and blue) on his surcoat. He holds his sword at the throat of the Alien Commander.

The Commander raises his hands (four fingers each).

SIR ROGER
(Breathing heavy)
Parvus! Get in here!

Brother Parvus runs in, clutching his rosary, looking around at the blinking lights in awe.

SIR ROGER
Try speaking Latin to it. See if it’s a demon or a Saracen trick.

Parvus approaches the terrified Alien Commander.

BROTHER PARVUS
(In Latin)
*In nomine Patris...*

The Alien blinks, confused. It produces a small box (a translator) and speaks into it. The box squawks.

ALIEN COMMANDER
(Electronic, synthesized voice)
You... are... lunatics.

SIR ROGER
(Grinning)
We are Englishmen. And I claim this... castle... in the name of King Edward.

Roger walks over to the massive viewport. He looks down at the English countryside below.

SIR ROGER (CONT'D)
Parvus... this ship flies?

BROTHER PARVUS
It came from the heavens, my lord.

Sir Roger sheathes his sword. A dangerous idea forms behind his eyes.

SIR ROGER
The King needs ships to cross the channel to France.

Roger pats the cold metal console.

SIR ROGER (CONT'D)
I think we can do better than France, Parvus. With a ship like this... we could take back Jerusalem.

Roger looks at the stars on the viewscreen.

SIR ROGER (CONT'D)
We’re going on a Crusade.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**TITLE CARD:**
**THE HIGH CRUSADE**

<summary>Thought for 11 seconds</summary>
&gt; **Initiating the Analysis**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m currently focused on the initial analysis. Right now, I&#x27;m meticulously examining the source material: a synopsis and script excerpt from *The High Crusade*. The goal is to fully grasp the narrative and its structure before proceeding. I&#x27;m taking note of key plot points, character introductions, and the overall tone.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dissecting the Scene**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ve been breaking down the first chapter, identifying scenes and their components. I&#x27;m focusing on the contrast between the medieval setting and the arrival of the alien ship in *The High Crusade*, aiming to establish this visually through scene descriptions and camera angles for the pilot episode&#x27;s shooting script.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Crafting the Visuals**
&gt; 
&gt; My focus has shifted towards the visual representation of the scenes. I&#x27;m actively considering camera angles and the overall aesthetic for the pilot episode. The contrast between the mundane medieval setting and the advanced alien technology is paramount. I&#x27;m exploring shots that emphasize the disparity in scale and texture, ensuring the visuals support the narrative. I am working on the scene descriptions.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Developing the Pilot&#x27;s Draft**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m now focusing on drafting the pilot episode&#x27;s shooting script, keeping my target audience in mind: a programmer who appreciates structure. I&#x27;ve broken down Chapter 1 into scenes and am meticulously crafting each one, paying close attention to visual details and the contrast between the medieval and sci-fi elements. I&#x27;m prioritizing clarity in the script&#x27;s format, using precise terminology like &quot;O.S.&quot; and &quot;POV&quot; to appeal to their analytical approach. I&#x27;m exploring shots and transitions, ensuring a logical flow, especially within the battle scenes.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Developing the Structure**
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I&#x27;m fully immersed in the process of script development. I&#x27;ve broken down Chapter 1 into scenes, ensuring they align with the inciting incident, conflict, and resolution. My primary focus is on crafting a shooting script, meticulously incorporating camera angles, transitions, and character cues. I&#x27;m taking the programmer&#x27;s perspective into account, ensuring the script is logically structured.
&gt; 
&gt; 
</details>
Here is the Shooting Script for the pilot episode of **THE HIGH CRUSADE**.

**NOTE TO DIRECTOR:**
*   **Visual Style:** The human world should be filmed in gritty, desaturated earth tones (think *The Last Duel* or *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*’s mud). The Alien world should be hyper-saturated, sterile, and anamorphic (think *J.J. Abrams' Star Trek*). The comedy comes from the collision of these two aesthetics.
*   **FX Notes:** The Alien dominance is brief. The disintegration effect should be horrifying initially, making the sudden turn to medieval brutality more shocking.

**SHOOTING SCRIPT**

**SCENE 1**

**1. EXT. LINCOLNSHIRE FIELDS - DAY**

**CU - BOOTS**
Heavy leather boots SLOG deep into grey, wet mud.

**WIDER**
A line of ARCHERS trudge through the muck. They look miserable. Cold breath mists in the air.

**SUPERIMPOSE:**
**ANSBY, ENGLAND - 1345 A.D.**

**TRACKING SHOT**
We move with SIR ROGER DE TOURNEVILLE (30s). He is clean-shaven, scarred, completely at ease in heavy chainmail.

<center>BROTHER PARVUS (V.O.)</center>
> I have been asked to write the history of these strange times. My name is Brother Parvus. I swear by the saints that every word is true.

Roger stops at a wooden fence. He looks at the troops with a critical eye.

**MED SHOT - ROGER AND OWAIN**
SIR OWAIN approaches. He looks worried.

<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> The archers are sluggish, Owain. If they loose that slowly in France, they’ll serve as pincushions for the Genoese crossbowmen.

<center>SIR OWAIN</center>
> They are tired, my lord. And fearful of the omens.

**CLOSE UP - ROGER**
He sneers.

<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> Omens do not win wars. Steel wins wars. Drill them again.

**CUT TO:**

**2. EXT. PASTURE - MOMENTS LATER**

**LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP**
The sun is suddenly BLOCKED. A shadow races across the ground at incredible speed.

**HIGH WIDE (CRANE)**
The entire camp goes silent. Horses rear.
A massive SHAPE descends.

**SOUND:** A PIERCING ELECTRONIC WHINE, transition to SUB-BASS THRUM.

**3. EXT. PASTURE - LANDING SITE**

**FULL SHOT - THE SHIP**
It is a cylinder, silver and seamless, a mile high. It crushes an old stone wall.
Use distinct scale: The ship makes the nearby castle look like a toy.

**INSERT - THE MUD**
Massive hydraulic landing gear crushes a patch of wildflowers and cow manure. 
Steam HISSES, turning the mud to baked clay instantly.

**REACTION SHOT - THE TROOPS**
ARCHERS drop their bows. Some fall to their knees praying.

**MED SHOT - ROGER & PARVUS**
Parvus is trembling, holding a wooden cross. Roger is squinting.

<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> Is that... French?

<center>BROTHER PARVUS</center>
> It is a tower of Babel, my lord. Or a demon’s chariot.

<center>SIR ROGER</center>

> Demon or Frenchman, it’s ruining my pasture.

**CUT TO:**

**4. EXT. ALIEN SHIP - RAMP**

**MECHANICAL SFX:** Psshhhhh-CLANK.

A ramp slides down.
At the top stands a WERSGOR SCOUT. 
**VFX:** He is blue-skinned, tailed, snout-faced. He wears a metallic tunic that glows slightly.

**POV - ALIEN (HUD OVERLAY)**
We see the humans through a digital filter. Target boxes appear over them.
**TEXT OVERLAY (ALIEN):** *SPECIES: PRIMITIVE. THREAT LEVEL: ZERO.*

**RESUME SCENE**
The Wersgor raises a silver tube (BLAST RIFLE).

**5. EXT. FIELD**

**WIDER**
The soldiers back away. Panic is setting in.

<center>SOLDIER #1</center>
> St. George protect us!

**MED SHOT - THE WERSGOR**
He aims at a YEOMAN (RED DICK) standing ten yards away.
He pulls the trigger.

**VFX SHOT**
A BEAM OF BLUE FIRE hits Red Dick.
There is no blood. He simply ATOMIZES. A pile of hot ash falls where a man stood.

**CLOSE UP - SIR ROGER**
**SLOW ZOOM IN.**
The fear doesn't hit him. The calculation does.
He looks at the ash pile. He looks at the Alien.

<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> (Sotto Voce)
> He killed Red Dick. That was my best fletcher.

**SOUND:** The sharp *SHING* of a broadsword being drawn.

<center>SIR ROGER (CONT'D)</center>
> (Bellowing)
> MONTJOIE! SAINT DENIS!

**6. EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS**

**HANDHELD - CHAOS**
Roger charges. He runs straight toward the giant silver tower.
The sheer insanity of it snaps the troops out of their trance.

<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> Have at them! For England!

<center>SIR ROGER (CONT'D)</center>

3.  The release.

**7. EXT. SHIP RAMP - SLO-MO**

**EXTREME CLOSE UP / CGI**
We follow the arrows.
The Wersgor taps his belt. A BLUE FORCE BUBBLE appears.
The arrows hit the bubble.
*The Concept:* The bubble flickers violently. It is trying to detect high-energy velocity. The heavy wood arrows are too slow for the sensors.
They push *through* the barrier.

**RESUME SPEED**
*THWACK. THWACK.*
The Alien is turned into a pincushion. He tumbles down the ramp.

**8. EXT. RAMP**

**TRACKING SHOT**
Roger hurdles the dead alien body without looking down.

<center>SIR ROGER</center>

**WIDE - SYMMETRICAL**
The aesthetic shifts abruptly. White panels. LED strips. Very clean.

**ACTION**
Muddy knights STORM in. They look absurd against the sci-fi background.
Two WERSGOR CREWMEN step out, fumbling with holsters. They look terrified.

**MED SHOT - OWAIN**
Owain swings a Morning Star (spiked mace).
*CRUNCH.*
The Alien goes down.

**CLOSE UP - ROGER**
He tackles the second alien, slamming him against a control panel. Sparks fly.

> (To Owain)
> Find the helm!

**10. INT. SHIP BRIDGE**

**ESTABLISHING**
Screens showing star maps.
The ALIEN COMMANDER enters commands frantically.

**DOOR BREACH**
The blast door doesn't slide open. It is wedges open by a HALBERD.
Roger squeezes through, covered in blue and red blood.

**MED SHOT**
Roger puts his sword tip to the Commander’s throat.
The Commander raises four-fingered hands.

<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> Parvus! Get in here!

Parvus runs in, panting, eyes wide as saucers.

<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> Try speaking Latin to it. See if it’s a demon or a Saracen trick.

**TWO SHOT - PARVUS AND ALIEN**

<center>BROTHER PARVUS</center>
> (Shaking)
> *In nomine Patris... et Filii...*

 The Alien pulls a TRANSLATOR BOX from his belt.
**SFX:** Electronic chirping, tuning into radio frequencies.

<center>ALIEN COMMANDER</center>
> (Synth Voice)
> You... are... lunatics.

**CLOSE UP - ROGER**
A slow, wolfish grin spreads across his face.

<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> We are Englishmen. And I claim this... castle... in the name of King Edward.

**11. INT. BRIDGE - VIEWPORT**

**WIDE**
Roger walks to the massive window. Outside, the English countryside looks small.
He touches the cold glass.

<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> Parvus... this ship flies?

<center>BROTHER PARVUS</center>
> It came from the heavens, my lord.

**CLOSE UP - ROGER**
The gears are turning. Ambition.

<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> The King needs ships to cross the channel to France.

He looks up at the Viewscreen. The stars are visible in the black void of space on the monitor.

<center>SIR ROGER (CONT'D)</center>
> But I think we can do better than France, Parvus. With a ship like this... we could take back Jerusalem.

Roger turns to his filthy, blood-covered men.

<center>SIR ROGER (CONT'D)</center>
> We’re going on a Crusade.

**CRANE UP AND OUT**
Pull back through the viewport, leaving the ship, going higher and higher until the silver cylinder is just a speck in the green fields of England.

### USER
  
Here is the Shooting Script for the pilot episode of **THE HIGH CRUSADE**.
**NOTE TO DIRECTOR:**
*   **Visual Style:** The human world should be filmed in gritty, desaturated earth tones (think _The Last Duel_ or _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_’s mud). The Alien world should be hyper-saturated, sterile, and anamorphic (think _J.J. Abrams' Star Trek_). The comedy comes from the collision of these two aesthetics.
*   **FX Notes:** The Alien dominance is brief. The disintegration effect should be horrifying initially, making the sudden turn to medieval brutality more shocking.

**SHOOTING SCRIPT**
**SCENE 1**
**1. EXT. LINCOLNSHIRE FIELDS - DAY**
**CU - BOOTS**
Heavy leather boots SLOG deep into grey, wet mud.
**WIDER**
A line of ARCHERS trudge through the muck. They look miserable. Cold breath mists in the air.
**SUPERIMPOSE:**
**ANSBY, ENGLAND - 1345 A.D.**
**TRACKING SHOT**
We move with SIR ROGER DE TOURNEVILLE (30s). He is clean-shaven, scarred, completely at ease in heavy chainmail.
<center>BROTHER PARVUS (V.O.)</center>
> I have been asked to write the history of these strange times. My name is Brother Parvus. I swear by the saints that every word is true.
Roger stops at a wooden fence. He looks at the troops with a critical eye.
**MED SHOT - ROGER AND OWAIN**
SIR OWAIN approaches. He looks worried.
<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> The archers are sluggish, Owain. If they loose that slowly in France, they’ll serve as pincushions for the Genoese crossbowmen.
<center>SIR OWAIN</center>
> They are tired, my lord. And fearful of the omens.
**CLOSE UP - ROGER**
He sneers.
<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> Omens do not win wars. Steel wins wars. Drill them again.
**CUT TO:**
**2. EXT. PASTURE - MOMENTS LATER**
**LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP**
The sun is suddenly BLOCKED. A shadow races across the ground at incredible speed.
**HIGH WIDE (CRANE)**
The entire camp goes silent. Horses rear.
A massive SHAPE descends.
**SOUND:** A PIERCING ELECTRONIC WHINE, transition to SUB-BASS THRUM.
**3. EXT. PASTURE - LANDING SITE**
**FULL SHOT - THE SHIP**
It is a cylinder, silver and seamless, a mile high. It crushes an old stone wall.
Use distinct scale: The ship makes the nearby castle look like a toy.
**INSERT - THE MUD**
Massive hydraulic landing gear crushes a patch of wildflowers and cow manure.
Steam HISSES, turning the mud to baked clay instantly.
**REACTION SHOT - THE TROOPS**
ARCHERS drop their bows. Some fall to their knees praying.
**MED SHOT - ROGER & PARVUS**
Parvus is trembling, holding a wooden cross. Roger is squinting.
<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> Is that... French?
<center>BROTHER PARVUS</center>
> It is a tower of Babel, my lord. Or a demon’s chariot.
<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> (Hand rests on sword hilt)
> Demon or Frenchman, it’s ruining my pasture.
**CUT TO:**
**4. EXT. ALIEN SHIP - RAMP**
**MECHANICAL SFX:** Psshhhhh-CLANK.
A ramp slides down.
At the top stands a WERSGOR SCOUT.
**VFX:** He is blue-skinned, tailed, snout-faced. He wears a metallic tunic that glows slightly.
**POV - ALIEN (HUD OVERLAY)**
We see the humans through a digital filter. Target boxes appear over them.
**TEXT OVERLAY (ALIEN):** _SPECIES: PRIMITIVE. THREAT LEVEL: ZERO._
**RESUME SCENE**
The Wersgor raises a silver tube (BLAST RIFLE).
**5. EXT. FIELD**
**WIDER**
The soldiers back away. Panic is setting in.
<center>SOLDIER #1</center>
> St. George protect us!
**MED SHOT - THE WERSGOR**
He aims at a YEOMAN (RED DICK) standing ten yards away.
He pulls the trigger.
**VFX SHOT**
A BEAM OF BLUE FIRE hits Red Dick.
There is no blood. He simply ATOMIZES. A pile of hot ash falls where a man stood.
**CLOSE UP - SIR ROGER**
**SLOW ZOOM IN.**
The fear doesn't hit him. The calculation does.
He looks at the ash pile. He looks at the Alien.
<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> (Sotto Voce)
> He killed Red Dick. That was my best fletcher.
**SOUND:** The sharp _SHING_ of a broadsword being drawn.
<center>SIR ROGER (CONT'D)</center>
> (Bellowing)
> MONTJOIE! SAINT DENIS!
**6. EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS**
**HANDHELD - CHAOS**
Roger charges. He runs straight toward the giant silver tower.
The sheer insanity of it snaps the troops out of their trance.
<center>SIR ROGER</center>
> Have at them! For England!
<center>SIR ROGER (CONT'D)</center>
> ARCHERS! LOOSE!
**QUICK CUTS:**

Turn this into a json - there should be a list of “scenes”, each containg a list of “shots”, each “shot” should have camera, framing, lighting, cast and characters, action blocking etc etc, everytyhing need to shoot the scene.

### ASSISTANT
<details type="reasoning" done="true" duration="16">
<summary>Thought for 16 seconds</summary>
&gt; **Parsing the Input Script**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m currently focused on parsing the screenplay input. I&#x27;m prioritizing the extraction of key elements such as scene headings, action lines, character names, and dialogue. My approach involves identifying patterns within the text to accurately categorize and structure the data. I&#x27;m refining the method to handle variations in formatting styles.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Refining the JSON Schema**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m now deep in the process of defining the JSON structure. My goal is to capture all essential script elements within it. I&#x27;m focusing on &quot;shots,&quot; ensuring each has detailed descriptions, including camera angles, lighting, and cast. I&#x27;m carefully considering how to represent the stylistic notes effectively within each scene and shot. I&#x27;m experimenting with a nested structure to accommodate &quot;global notes&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Outlining the Data Flow**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ve started diagramming the data flow. First, the parsing stage will extract screenplay elements. Next, it will be fed into the JSON structure generator. The stylistic notes will be integrated at the shot level. I&#x27;m exploring various algorithms to ensure efficient and accurate data extraction. The crucial part now is linking the overall style to individual shots.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Formulating JSON Elements**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m presently building the JSON schema, working towards a nested structure. Each scene will contain shots with detailed camera instructions, character details, and action lines. The &quot;global_notes&quot; section is also being refined. I&#x27;m focusing on &quot;style&quot; application at the scene level to integrate visual guidelines. The next step is a concrete scene-by-scene content drafting.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Constructing Scene Schemas**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m now generating the JSON content, scene by scene, using the provided screenplay as a guide. Each scene incorporates &quot;shots&quot; with details on camera work, cast, and action lines. I&#x27;m assigning stylistic notes within each shot to guide visual elements. The next stage is to develop each section for its specific content and integrate the stylistic notes.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Implementing Style Guidelines**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m now integrating the style guidelines for each scene. I&#x27;m focusing on ensuring the &quot;Human World&quot; and &quot;Alien World&quot; aesthetics directly affect the visual aspects specified in each shot&#x27;s details. I&#x27;m going to map the style cues to the correct lighting and color information. Furthermore, I&#x27;ll be adding props and production design elements for each shot.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Generating the Scene-Specific Content**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m now generating content for each scene. Each &quot;shot&quot; is being populated with camera angles, framing descriptions, cast details, action lines, and dialogue snippets. I&#x27;m focusing on &quot;Human World&quot; and &quot;Alien World&quot; aesthetics, adjusting lighting and color accordingly. Props are being defined within &quot;production_design&quot;. The goal is to fully render each scene.

The images above were done using Nano Banana pro (google gemini 3 pro image)  I used the same ai for creating the script etc.

But then I wanted to move into video so I went over to replicate.com and used google veo-3.1

here was my first prompt:

--------------
{ "shot_number": "1A", "framing": "Extreme Close Up (ECU)", "subject": "Boots", "camera_movement": "Static or slight handheld shake", "audio": "SFX: Wet suction/slogging sounds", "action": "Heavy leather boots step deep into grey mud.", "props": "Period-accurate leather boots, excessive mud" },
--------------

I was trying to use the data from the previous step, it worked ok except I forgot that I should remove the example reference images so the bboot had a replicate logo on it!

Next I tried to create the next shot and used the heading information as well as the shot information:

------------------------
{ "project_title": "THE HIGH CRUSADE", "episode_type": "Pilot Teaser", "director_notes": { "visual_style_human": "Gritty, desaturated earth tones. Reference: 'The Last Duel' / 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' (mud).", "visual_style_alien": "Hyper-saturated, sterile, anamorphic lens flares. Reference: 'J.J. Abrams Star Trek'.", "fx_philosophy": "Alien disintegration is horrifying/clean. Human violence is messy/brutal/medieval." }, "scenes": [ { "scene_number": 1, "slugline": "EXT. LINCOLNSHIRE FIELDS - DAY", "environmental_conditions": "Grey, wet, cold, muddy. Breath misting.", "lighting_tone": "Overcast, flat natural light, desaturated palette.", "shots": [ { "shot_number": "1B", "framing": "Wide Shot", "subject": "Archers", "camera_movement": "Static", "vfx_overlay": "SUPERIMPOSE: ANSBY, ENGLAND - 1345 A.D.", "action": "A line of archers trudge through muck. They look miserable.", "special_effects": "Misting breath (practical or subtle CGI)" },
-----------------------

It worked ok except the overlay text appeared twice.

Next shot prompt

----------------
{ "project_title": "THE HIGH CRUSADE", "episode_type": "Pilot Teaser", "director_notes": { "visual_style_human": "Gritty, desaturated earth tones. Reference: 'The Last Duel' / 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' (mud).", "visual_style_alien": "Hyper-saturated, sterile, anamorphic lens flares. Reference: 'J.J. Abrams Star Trek'.", "fx_philosophy": "Alien disintegration is horrifying/clean. Human violence is messy/brutal/medieval." }, "scenes": [ { "scene_number": 1, "slugline": "EXT. LINCOLNSHIRE FIELDS - DAY", "environmental_conditions": "Grey, wet, cold, muddy. Breath misting.", "lighting_tone": "Overcast, flat natural light, desaturated palette.", "shots": [ { "shot_number": "1C", "framing": "Tracking Shot / Medium", "subject": "Sir Roger de Tourneville", "camera_movement": "Dolly or Steadicam tracking backward with subject", "cast": ["Sir Roger", "Brother Parvus (V.O.)"], "dialogue_snippet": "Parvus (V.O.): I swear by the saints that every word is true.", "costume": "Full chainmail, scarred face, clean-shaven.", "action": "Roger walks with ease while others struggle. He stops at a wooden fence." }
---------------

That worked ok but the background lacked detail and the knight was too ugly, my fault for not specifying, so I decided to do some character devvelopment first:

---------------
A ruggedly handom Knight preparing to go off to the crusades in the 14th century. He is wearing light armour, bright fabrics, behind him in a muddy field outside the village his troops begin to muster.
----------------

That worked ok even without much detail and then I used the image as a reference image and again in nano banana I went:

----------------------
Make a contact sheet of continuity photos including full body, head, face, makeup, hair etc. 14th Century, off to the crusades, mustering his men in the village. Multiple headshots, full body, multiple outfits (casual for in house, light armour for the field).
----------------------

This worked well and made a 4 by 3 grid of images with different angles, poses, costumes that would be a good reference image to feed to either nano banana again to put the character into a scene. Or as a reference image for veo-3.1 to put the right character into a video.

This is as far as I've got so far and I can see it is working though slowly and too manually, that's where I decided to make this AI Assisted Movie Maker - each step uses AI anyway, and I just need to chain them together.

However the break-points between steps in the app currently don't seem to align very well with what came naturally when I did it by hand.

I want you to revise the plan and update the program to reflect an automation tool that helps me with the minimalist workflow i've done manually, and with room for the extras like locations ("The village of Avery") and sets ("the dining room in the vicerage")
